The usual choice when dealing with image classification consists in using a toy dataset called MNIST database, which is very popular especially in supervised learning. This is a collection of grayscale images representing the handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

The MNIST database, however, has been heavily analyzed thorough the years, and some criticisms arised due to the extreme ease with which different supervised learning models are able to reach an accuracy that is close to 100%.

Therefore it may be more interesting and challenging to study one of its successors, that is the Fashion-MNIST. This dataset is part of a research project conducted by Zalando Research and was created with the aim of replacing the MNIST dataset for the role of benchmark in building and evaluation of machine learning algorithms, since the two datasets share many features.

Nowadays many articles have been written using this new dataset as a benchmark for supervised and unsupervised learning models.
